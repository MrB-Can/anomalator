# Design Document: Anomaly Generator

## System Architecture

The Anomaly Generator software consists of several key components that work together to facilitate the injection of anomalies into databases:

1. Database Connection Component: Responsible for establishing connections with target databases and providing access to their data.

2. Injection Component: Handles the injection of anomalies into the selected database tables or columns based on user-defined configurations.

3. Database Profiling Component: Profiles the target databases to gather information about their schemas, tables, and columns, enabling users to select and configure anomalies accurately.

4. Anomaly Definitions Component: Stores the definitions and descriptions of various anomalies, allowing users to choose from a predefined set.

5. Anomaly Generator Component: Generates the necessary anomaly injection instructions based on user selections and configurations.

6. User Interface: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to connect to databases, select anomalies, and configure the injection process.

The components interact as follows:

- The User Interface initiates the connection process by providing the necessary credentials and connection parameters.
- The Database Connection Component establishes the connection with the target database.
- The Database Profiling Component retrieves the schema information from the database and presents it to the user interface.
- The User selects the desired anomalies from the available options, configuring them as needed.
- The Anomaly Generator Component receives the user's selections and generates the anomaly injection instructions.
- The Injection Component applies the generated instructions to the target database, injecting the selected anomalies.
- The User Interface provides feedback on the injection process and displays any relevant information or error messages.

The architecture follows a modular approach, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in incorporating new anomaly types, database connectors, or user interface enhancements. It leverages the principle of separation of concerns to ensure clear responsibilities and maintainability.
## Database Abstraction Layer

Recognizing the need to support multiple database systems with distinct SQL dialects, a Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) is introduced into the system architecture. This component abstracts the nuances and differences in SQL syntax across various databases, allowing the Anomaly Generator software to interact uniformly with any supported database system.

The DAL acts as a translation layer between the generic database commands issued by the software and the specific commands supported by the target database. This allows the software to be written in a database-agnostic way, significantly improving maintainability and extensibility.

The areas that the DAL addresses include:

- **Data Types**: The layer maps equivalent data types across different databases, catering to specificities in how each database handles different kinds of data.
- **Functions**: The DAL provides translations for different SQL functions across databases, ensuring seamless interaction irrespective of the underlying database system.
- **Subqueries and Joins**: It abstracts the differences in handling subqueries and joins across different databases.
- **Full-Text Search**: The layer handles variations in full-text search capabilities and syntax across databases.
- **Indexing and Constraints**: It provides consistent handling of indexing and constraints, abstracting away the syntax differences.
- **Stored Procedures and Triggers**: If applicable, the DAL will handle the differences in creating and calling stored procedures and triggers.
- **Paging and Limiting Result Sets**: The layer abstracts the differing ways databases limit results returned by a query.
- **Error Handling**: The DAL provides a uniform interface for error handling, capturing and translating database-specific error messages into a generic format that the software can interpret and respond to consistently.

To implement the DAL, the design and development process will involve identifying the commonalities and differences among the target databases, defining the interface and behavior of the DAL, implementing the database-specific code, and rigorously testing the layer with each of the target databases.

This approach allows the Anomaly Generator to support a wide range of database systems without requiring substantial modifications to the core anomaly generation and injection components, thus ensuring broad usability while preserving maintainability.

## Data Flows and Interactions

Data flows through the Anomaly Generator software in the following manner:

1. User Inputs: Users provide database connection details and select the target tables or columns for anomaly injection.
2. Database Connection: The software establishes a connection with the target database using the provided credentials.
3. Database Profiling: The software retrieves schema information, including tables and columns, from the connected database.
4. User Interface: The user interface presents the retrieved schema information to the user, enabling them to select tables and columns for anomaly injection.
5. User Configurations: Users select specific anomaly types and configure their parameters (e.g., percentage of anomalies, anomaly patterns, data ranges).
6. Anomaly Generator: The software generates the anomaly injection instructions based on the user's selections and configurations.
7. Injection Process: The software applies the generated instructions to the target database, injecting the selected anomalies.
8. Feedback and Reporting: The user interface provides real-time feedback on the injection process, displaying progress, success, or error messages.

The data flow follows a clear path, starting from user inputs and progressing through various components until the anomalies are injected into the target database. At each stage, the necessary data is passed along to facilitate the anomaly generation and injection process.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

The Anomaly Generator software employs various algorithms and data structures for anomaly generation and processing:

- Anomaly Generation Algorithms: The software utilizes algorithms to generate different types of anomalies based on user configurations. These algorithms ensure that anomalies align with the desired patterns, data ranges, or statistical distributions.

- Data Structures: The software leverages data structures such as arrays, dictionaries, or graphs to store and manipulate the anomaly definitions, user selections, and configuration parameters. These data structures provide efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms, enabling fast and accurate anomaly generation.

- Statistical and Mathematical Models: Certain anomaly types may rely on statistical or mathematical models to generate anomalies that conform to specific distributions or patterns. The software incorporates these models to ensure the anomalies align with the desired statistical properties.

The choice of algorithms and data structures is driven by the specific requirements of each anomaly type and the need for efficient anomaly generation and processing. Careful consideration is given to selecting algorithms that produce realistic anomalies and data structures that optimize performance and memory usage.
