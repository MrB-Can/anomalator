# Anomaly Generator Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
The Anomaly Generator is a software tool designed to help organizations test their data quality tools and simulate anomalous conditions in their systems. It enables users to inject various types of anomalies into databases, allowing the assessment of infrastructure resilience and the effectiveness of data quality tools.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and reliable Anomaly Generator software. The software should support various types of databases, allow the selection of different types of anomalies, and provide options for scheduling and customization.

## 3. Project Scope
The scope of this project includes:
- Designing and implementing the Anomaly Generator software
- Supporting multiple database systems
- Providing a user-friendly interface for selecting and configuring anomalies
- Allowing options for scheduling periodic runs or one-time injections
- Ensuring secure storage of customer credentials
- Implementing security measures and compliance with relevant standards
- Performance testing and optimization for efficient anomaly generation
- Creating comprehensive documentation and user manuals

Out of scope for this project:
- Integration with specific data quality tools
- Production-level scalability and high availability requirements

## 4. Project Schedule
Key milestones for the project include:

- **Project Setup**: Completed
- **Technology Stack and Framework Decision**: Completed
- **Project Documentation**: In Progress
- **Design and Development**: Pending
- **Testing**: Pending
- **Deployment**: Pending

## 5. Resource Allocation and Roles
As a one-person team, I'll be handling all roles in this project. The roles include:

- **Project Manager**: Oversee the project, ensure goals and deadlines are met
- **Software Developer**: Implement the design of the software, perform coding tasks
- **QA Tester**: Perform testing to ensure the software works as expected
- **Release Manager**: Handle software release and deployment

## 6. Risk Assessment
Potential risks in the project include:

- **Technical Difficulties**: Encountering technical problems or limitations during development
- **Time Constraints**: Not being able to meet the deadlines due to unexpected issues or complexities
- **Software Bugs**: The software may have undiscovered bugs that could affect functionality

## 7. Contingency Plan
To manage potential risks and unforeseen issues, the following strategies will be implemented:

- **Time Buffer**: Allocate extra time for tasks to accommodate unforeseen issues or complexities
- **Alternative Technologies**: Have alternative technology options in mind in case the primary choice proves to be problematic
- **Task Prioritization**: Prioritize tasks based on their impact on the project's progress and the software's functionality
- **Automated Testing**: Use automated testing tools to help identify bugs or issues in the software faster

## 8. Stakeholder Communication
Regular communication with stakeholders will be maintained throughout the project. Monthly status updates and progress reports will be provided to keep stakeholders informed about the project's progress, achievements, and any potential changes or risks.

## 9. Quality Assurance
Quality assurance will be an integral part of the project. The software will be thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality, reliability, and performance. Key metrics such as anomaly injection success rate, response time, and resource utilization will be measured and monitored.

## 10. Review and Update Cycle
The project plan will be reviewed and updated on a biweekly basis. This review process will ensure that the plan remains aligned with project goals, accounts for any changes or new requirements, and maintains its relevance throughout the project lifecycle.
