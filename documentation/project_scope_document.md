# Project Scope Document: Anomalator

## Project Goals
The main goal of the Anomalator project is to develop a software tool that injects anomalies into databases. This tool aims to assist organizations in testing their data quality tools and simulating how their systems might behave under anomalous conditions.

## Stakeholders
While the Anomalator tool will be developed within our team, its stakeholders are widespread. They range from internal team members looking to demonstrate the tool's capabilities to external organizations eager to test their data quality tooling and infrastructure resilience.

## Key Deliverables
The principal deliverable is a user-friendly software package, complete with an SDK. The software should take connection information and user inputs to insert data anomalies into various databases.

## Timeline
This project is envisioned as a long-term, part-time commitment, with an MVP to be ready within a few weeks of project initiation.

## Milestones
- Prototype: July 10, 2023
- Testing: July 15, 2023
- MVP: July 31, 2023

## Budget and Resources
This project has a flexible budget. Key resources include cloud services, the appropriate IDE, and testing databases.

## Risks
Potential risks include technical challenges related to data profiling before generating anomalies and potential connectivity issues with some database systems.

## Success Metrics
Success will be measured by the system's ability to reliably connect to various systems and perform its core function of anomaly generation effectively.
